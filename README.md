🤟 SignSpeak-AI

> AI-Powered Real-Time Sign Language Communication Assistant

SignSpeak-AI is an AI-powered mobile application that bridges communication between hearing individuals and the Deaf community by translating spoken Indonesian into sign language gestures in real time.

Instead of displaying only text, SignSpeak-AI understands the context of spoken language using a Large Language Model (LLM), extracts meaningful gesture tokens, and plays corresponding sign language videos sequentially.

🧠 AI Pipeline

Our AI pipeline consists of four main stages.

1. Speech Recognition

The application captures the user's speech using Flutter Speech-to-Text.

Example


```
Halo apa kabar
```

↓

Recognized Text

```
Halo apa kabar
```

---

2. Context Understanding

Instead of performing simple keyword matching, our Large Language Model first understands the semantic meaning of the sentence.

The AI simultaneously performs:

- Context Understanding
- English Translation
- Gesture Token Extraction

Example

```
{
  "translation": "Hello, how are you?",
  "gesture": [
    "halo",
    "apa",
    "kabar"
  ]
}
```

---

3. Gesture Mapping

Each extracted gesture is mapped into our cloud-based gesture database stored in Supabase Storage.

Example

```
halo
apa
kabar
```

↓

```
halo.mp4
apa.mp4
kabar.mp4
```

↓

Public URLs

---

4. Sequential Gesture Playback

Gesture videos are played automatically in sequence.

```
halo.mp4

↓

apa.mp4

↓

kabar.mp4
```

This creates a smooth sign language animation for the user.

SignVideoPlayer

Automatically plays multiple gesture videos in sequence.



🎯 Why AI?

Traditional systems perform simple keyword matching.

SignSpeak-AI uses a Large Language Model to understand the meaning of a sentence before selecting the most appropriate sign language gestures.

This enables more accurate gesture selection while preserving the context of natural conversation.



🔮 Future Work

- Real-time streaming conversation
- AI-generated sign language avatar
- Larger BISINDO gesture database
- Offline gesture caching
- Support for multiple sign languages
